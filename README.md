# Parity and BCC Functions

This C# console application provides functions for generating and checking even and odd parity bits and calculating/checking Block Check Character (BCC) with even and odd parity.

## Usage

1. **Run the Program:**
   - Compile and run the `ParityAndBCCFunctions.cs` file using a C# compiler or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C#.

2. **Input Sequence of Bits:**
   - Enter a sequence of bits interactively, one line per bit. Leave an empty line to end the input.

3. **Results:**
   - The program will display the bits with even and odd parity, along with the parity check results.
   - It will also calculate and display the Block Check Character (BCC) with even and odd parity, along with the check results.
